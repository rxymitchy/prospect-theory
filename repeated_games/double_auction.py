# Double Auction Game
class DoubleAuction:
  '''
  A double auction game with midpoint pricing. Please let me know if you think a different pricing mechanism is better.
  other than that, very similar to the game env, using state indexing with base n^2 where n is the action size. 

  Another important consideration: should we have no trade be 0 reward or -1?
  -1 might inspire greater exploration early on
